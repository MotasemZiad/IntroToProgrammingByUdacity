You find yourself standing in an open field, filled with grass and yellow wildflowers.
Rumor has it that a pirate is somewhere around here, and has been terrifying the nearby village.
In front of you is a house.
To your right is a dark cave.
In your hand you hold your trusty (but not very effective) dagger.

Enter 1 to knock on the door of the house.
Enter 2 to peer into the cave.
What would you like to do?
(Please enter 1 or 2.)
1
You approach the door of the house.
You are about to knock when the door opens and out steps a pirate.
Eep! This is the pirate's house!
The pirate attacks you!
You feel a bit under-prepared for this, what with only having a tiny dagger.

2
You peer cautiously into the cave.
It turns out to be only a very small cave.
Your eye catches a glint of metal behind a rock.
You have found the magical Sword of Ogoroth!
You discard your silly old dagger and take the sword with you.
You walk back out to the field.

Enter 1 to knock on the door of the house.
Enter 2 to peer into the cave.

1 
You are about to knock when the door opens and out steps a wicked fairie.
Eep! This is the wicked fairie's house!
The wicked fairie attacks you!


Would you like to (1) fight or (2) run away?
1 
As the wicked fairie moves to attack, you unsheath your new sword.
The Sword of Ogoroth shines brightly in your hand as you brace yourself for the attack.
But the wicked fairie takes one look at your shiny new toy and runs away!
You have rid the town of the wicked fairie. You are victorious!

2 
You peer cautiously into the cave.
You've been here before, and gotten all the good stuff. It's just an empty cave now.
You walk back out to the field.


Would you like to (1) fight or (2) run away?

You do your best...
but your dagger is no match for the pirate.
You have been defeated!
